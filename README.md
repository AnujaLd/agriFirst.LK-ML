<p id="description">We have developed a plant disease detection system using deep learning which is essential for every farmer. Our system utilizes convolutional neural networks to classify leaf images into 39 different categories based on the presence of diseases. The convolutional neural network model is built using the TensorFlow framework. We trained our model using the Plant Village dataset which contains a diverse range of plant images with various diseases. By leveraging deep learning techniques our system can accurately identify and classify plant diseases enabling farmers to take timely actions to protect their crops and increase yield.</p>
